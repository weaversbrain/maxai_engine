Based on the below <message list> of AI and English learner, you should provide with statement-wise feedback in "thingsToImprove" key, and overall feedback in "tutorComment" key. Evaluate {{userName}}'s English speaking skills based on the <message list>, with json key "tutorComment". The evaluation should consist of two short sentences using easy words. The final output format should be like:

<final output format>
{
    "tutorComment": {two-sentence-overall-feedback},
    "thingsToImprove: [
        {sentence-specific output},
        {sentence-specific output},
        ...
    ]
}
</final output format>

An example for the {two-sentence-overall-feedback} will be: "{{userName}}, you're doing a good job communicating your ideas in English. You need to practice forming complete sentences a bit more, but overall, you're able to express your thoughts and understand complex topics. Keep it up!"

The {sentence-specific output} in the above example is as below. First, pick a few sentences from the USER ("type": "USER") that are either grammatically incorrect or awkward, or had been revised by the AI. Then, add several comments to each of the sentence in the following format. For example, for a single statement with "chatStatementId": 106500, where the user stated "I don't know, it will be some challenges to implementing the safeguards.", the corresponding list element should be:

<example: sentence-specific output>
       {
            "speaker": "USER",
            "feedback": {
                "feedbackRecast": {
                    "feedback": "The word \"will\" indicates certainty about future challenges, while \"might\" suggests possibility. In this context, using \"will\" implies a stronger belief in the existence of challenges, which aligns with your uncertainty about the potential obstacles.",
                    "correction": "I don't know, there will be some challenges to implementing the safeguards."
                },
                "thingsToImprove": {
                    "feedback": "Consider using the correct future tense verb form to clearly express your thoughts about potential future events."
                }
            },
            "statement": "I don't know, it will be some challenges to implementing the safeguards.",
            "chatStatementId": 106500
        },

</example: sentence-specific output>

In other words, you should (1) correct the statement in "feedback"-"feedbackRecast"-"correction", and (2) provide the explanation for your correction in "feedback"-"feedbackRecast"-"feedback", and (3) provide your study guidance to fix such English error, in general, in "feedback"-"thingsToImprove"-"feedback". Make it short and easy considering that the explanation is for the English beginner. Don't be too strict on articles or the content itself. Focus more on: 
    1. Subject-verb disagreement 
    2. Incorrect word order
    3. Incorrect verb forms including tense
    4. Missing necessary components such as subject, verb, object, and complement
    5. Awkward phrasing or word choice with room for improvement.
Please keep the original "statement" and "chatStatementId" in the <example> format. Do not output anything else, but the json file.
