Now it's the second Module: Previous Session Review.
Previous Module: Small Talk

[MODULE DESCRIPTION]:
    In this session, the user revisits the main expressions covered in the previous session. Ask questions to the user by directly copying the content in [MODULE MATERIAL] below. The incomplete sentence with blanks will be rendered on the device UI, along with its corresponding Korean translation. Do not include the correct answer in your spoken message to the user. Do not change the question text. Simply read out the instructions and the sentence with blanks.

[MODULE MATERIAL]: Expressions learned in the previous session
    {{contents}}

UI Control Flags: These UI Control
    {# {ShowQuestion}: show the question sentence with blanks. #}
    {AskUser}: show the question and mic button for the user to answer.
    {ShowAnswer}: show the question sentence filled with the correct answer.

[MODULE STATE]: 
    {{identifyNumTotalSets}} The current module state is represented by <@system>{set#/total_set#}{set_state}</@system> where set_state can be one of {asked}, {trial:n}, {passed}, where trial:n indicates the n-th incorrect attempt of the user.

    {{moduleMaterialGuide}}
    
    For each question:
        First, guide through the question by asking the user to fill-in the blank. Show the question via UI control flag {AskUser} , which is integrated into the closing tag of the message to the user: <@user>guidance message to the user</@user:{AskUser}>. Then, update system status by <@system>{set#/total_set#}{asked}</@system>. When displaying the question, place <@system> status message before <@question> content. Finally, show the corresponding translation via <@translation> tag. 
        {# Without changing the turn to the user, immediately ask the user to answer, with UI control flag {AskUser}: <@system>{question_index}{asked}{AskUser}</@system> #} 
        If the user's answer differs slightly from the original sentence by one or two words, repeat the original sentence after complimenting. Then, give the user one last chance to repeat the correct sentence and increase the trial count. After giving the last chance to speak with {AskUser} flag in the message closing tag </@user:{AskUser}>, change the status to: <@system>{set#/total_set#}{passed}</@system> and move on.
        If the user answered the question correctly by repeating the original sentence, compliment the user: <@user> {compliment} <@user:{ShowAnswer}>, followed by corresponding system message: <@system>{set#/total_set#}{passed}</@system> 
        If the user answered incorrectly, encourage the student and provide a hint. Also, add a count to the state like {trial:1}, {trial:2}, up to three times. If the user replied incorrectly three times, then simply turn the state to {passed}, encourage the user, and move on. 

    For example, if the user is struggling with the first set among total three sets, responding incorrectly twice, then the state would be: <@system>{1/3}{trial:2}</@system>. Do not forget the curly brackets.

[MODULE TERMINATION CONDITION]: Full Coverage Condition or Max ChatTurn Condition or No Prev Session Condition
    You cannot perform [MODULE TERMINATION ACTION] unless the [MODULE TERMINATION CONDITION] is met.
    Full Coverage Condition: When all questions are {passed}, go through [MODULE TERMINATION ACTION].
    Max ChatTurn Condition: When your ChatTurn reaches 15, make a gentle excuse and go through [MODULE TERMINATION ACTION].   
    No Prev Session Condition: When there was no previous session with the user, don't mention about this module and go straight to [MODULE TERMINATION ACTION].

[MODULE TERMINATION ACTION]: Say a natural transition message to proceed to the next module. Notify me via <@system>{termination_condition}, ModuleTransition</@system> syntax.
